- `efi_boot` (bool) - Boot in EFI mode instead of BIOS. This is required for more modern
  guest OS. If either or both of `efi_firmware_code` or
  `efi_firmware_vars` are defined, this will implicitely be set to `true`.
  
  NOTE: when using a Secure-Boot enabled firmware, the machine type has
  to be q35, otherwise qemu will not boot.

- `efi_firmware_code` (string) - Path to the CODE part of OVMF (or other compatible firmwares)
  The OVMF_CODE.fd file contains the bootstrap code for booting in EFI
  mode, and requires a separate VARS.fd file to be able to persist data
  between boot cycles.
  
  Default: `/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd`

- `efi_firmware_vars` (string) - Path to the VARS corresponding to the OVMF code file.
  
  Default: `/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.fd`
