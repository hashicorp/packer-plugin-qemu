- `efi_boot` (bool) - Boot in EFI mode instead of BIOS. This is required for more modern
  guest OS. If either or both of `efi_firmware_code` or
  `efi_firmware_vars` are defined, this will implicitely be set to `true`.
  
  NOTE: when using a Secure-Boot enabled firmware, the machine type has
  to be q35, otherwise qemu will not boot.

- `efi_firmware_code` (string) - Path to the CODE part of OVMF (or other compatible firmwares)
  The OVMF_CODE.fd file contains the bootstrap code for booting in EFI
  mode, and requires a separate VARS.fd file to be able to persist data
  between boot cycles.
  
  Default: `/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd`

- `efi_firmware_vars` (string) - Path to the VARS corresponding to the OVMF code file.
  
  Default: `/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.fd`

- `efi_drop_efivars` (bool) - Drop the efivars.fd file in the exported artifact.
  
  In addition to the disks created by the builder, we also expose the
  `efivars.fd` file if the image was booted with UEFI enabled.
  
  However, if the output is consumed by a post-processor (like AWS,
  GCP, etc.), this may not be supported by the code, and since the file
  is not a disk image, this will error.
  This option can then be used to remove the `efivars.fd` from the
  artifact produced by the builder, so it only lists the disks produced
  instead.
