- `cpus` (int) - The number of virtual cpus to use when building the VM.
  
  If undefined, the value will either be `1`, or the product of
  `sockets * cpus * threads`
  
  If this is defined in conjunction with any topology specifier (sockets,
  cores and/or threads), the smallest of the two will be used.
  
  If the cpu count is the only thing specified, qemu's default behaviour
  regarding topology will be applied.
  The behaviour depends on the version of qemu; before version 6.2, sockets
  were preferred to cores, from version 6.2 onwards, cores are preferred.

- `sockets` (int) - The number of sockets to use when building the VM.
   The default is `1` socket.
   The socket count must not be higher than the CPU count.

- `cores` (int) - The number of cores per CPU to use when building the VM.
   The default is `1` core per CPU.

- `threads` (int) - The number of threads per core to use when building the VM.
   The default is `1` thread per core.
